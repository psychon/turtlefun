# Turtlefun
Having fun with turtle graphics and the very simple Euler Spiral algorithm proposed by [@Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile "Numberphile Profile") on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/ "Youtube") on February 1st, 2022 in their video titled [The Plotting of Beautiful Curves (Euler Spirals and Sierpiński Triangles) - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMBj2fp52tA "The Plotting of Beautiful Curves").

The Video created using this code can be found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/ "Youtube") - [ A deep dive into ‪@numberphile‬'s turtle graphics Euler spiral algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx1d8x0gIu4 "A deep dive into ‪@numberphile‬'s turtle graphics Euler spiral algorithm").

This is a collection of code I used to animate drawings and research the algorithm. It is at is is and how it developed during the journey. The easiest way to try something would be

poetry install
poetry run turtlefun spiral -t 6.609375
```
Have fun and do not get dizzy by all the turning!
